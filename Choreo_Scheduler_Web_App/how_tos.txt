    This app has token authentication installed (HTTPS remains a todo). Any view that includes
    this Mixin automatically gains this authentication. To submit a request,
    => Alternatively, just use curl
    try: curl -X 'http:/<your_domain_here>/api/<api endpoint>' -H 'Authorization: Token <your_token>'
    You can get your token from the "Tokens DB" (see populate_db_scripts for the import)

    Go into views.py and remove all DefaultsMixins from all views that extend it.

Logging in:
Need to specify your TOKEN in request header (instead of using CSRF tokens, use standard authtokens)
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "Authorization: "
  --request POST \
  --data '{"username":"xyz","password":"xyz"}' \
  http://localhost:3000/api/login
